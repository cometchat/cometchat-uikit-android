## Prerequisites

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/cometchat/cometchat-uikit-android.git
   ```

2. Checkout v5 branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout v5
   ```

3. Open the project in Android Studio by navigating to the cloned directory and open the `sample-app-java+push-notification` folder.

4. Sync Gradle to ensure all dependencies are downloaded.

5. `[Optional]` Enter your CometChat _`App ID`_, _`Region`_, and _`Auth Key`_ in the [AppCredentials.java](src/main/java/com/cometchat/sampleapp/java/fcm/AppCredentials.java) file:

6. Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) by following the below steps
    - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a project.
    - Add your Android app to the Firebase project and download the `google-services.json` file.
    - Place the `google-services.json` file in the `sample-app-java+push-notification/` directory of your project.

   - Go to the [Notification Documentation](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/notifications/push-integration) and follow integration steps.
   - Note the provider id entered while configuring the Push Notifications in CometChat Dashboard.
